# bifidcracker
A ciphertext only bifid cracker

This cracker was primarily based upon [this article](http://practicalcryptography.com/cryptanalysis/stochastic-searching/cryptanalysis-bifid-cipher/).

Run *make* to build the binary, then run with ./bin/bifid. Put the file you wish to decode as the first argument.<br>

Note: the file must have only upper case characters, no newlines, and no 'J's.<br>

TODO:<br>

	* Automatically add spaces
